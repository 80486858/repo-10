<h1 align="center">Datasets in the Open MatSci ML Toolkit</h1>

The MatSci ML Benchmark contains diverse sets of tasks (energy prediction, force prediction, property prediction) across a broad range of datasets (OpenCatalyst Project [1], Materials Project [2], LiPS [3], OQMD [4], NOMAD [5], Carolina Materials Database [6]). Most of the data is related to energy prediction task, which is the most common property tracked for most materials systems in the literature. The codebase support single-task learning, as well as multi-task (training one model for multiple tasks within a dataset) and multi-date (training a model across multiple datsets with a common property).

### OpenCatalyst Project

The OpenCatalyst dataset [1]  was originally published by Meta's Fundamental AI Research (FAIR) group with a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 (CC BY 4.0) license. Our work leverages builds upon the implementation in our original release [7] with the same license framework.  [S2EF](https://github.com/IntelLabs/matsciml/scripts/preprocess_dgl_ef.py) can be download using a preprocessing script and [IS2RE](https://zenodo.org/record/7411133) has ready-made Zenodo.

### Materials Project

The Materials Project (MP) [2] is released under a CC BY 4.0 license and maintained by Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. Setting up MP datasets first requires access to the Materials Project API by creating an account on the [original website](https://materialsproject.org). The API key may then be set to an environment variable: `export MP_API_KEY=your-api-key` to interact with the command-line interface to query for specific data, or rely on pre-configured YAML configurations to process pre-defined splits we refer to in this paper.


### LiPS

The LiPS dataset is also released under a CC BY 4.0 license, which can be accessed via the original release in [Materials Cloud](https://archive.materialscloud.org/record/2022.45).

The LiPS data splits used in the experiments are included in the codebase folders `matsciml/datastes/lips/base/{train, val, test}`. To create the splits, we download the dataset from it's original release and split randomly into 70%, 20% and 10% chunks for training, validation and testing. A dev set is also included in `matsciml/datasets/lips/devset` which holds 200 samples.

### OQMD

The Open Quantum Materials Database (OQMD) [4] aims to create a comprehensive and accessible database of materials properties calculated by density functional theory (DFT). OQMD contains more than 1,022,000 entries of different compounds, including their total energy, volume, magnetic moment, band gap, density of states, and crystal structure. Additionally, OQMD also provides tools for analyzing the thermodynamic stability, phase diagrams, reaction energies, and synthesis conditions of materials. OQMD is created and maintained by the Wolverton Research Group at Northwestern University, and it is freely available for download or online access at the [OQMD website](https://www.oqmd.org). OQMD is a valuable resource for materials design and discovery, as it enables high-throughput screening of materials based on various criteria and machine learning methods. The OQMD also supports the Materials Genome Initiative, which aims to accelerate the development of new materials for various applications. We construct a random dataset split based of 1,022,595 bulk material structures in the dataset with a 20% validation split. OQMD represents the largest collection of bulk material formation energy calculation, including more sample than Materials Project, NOMAD and CMD combined.

### NOMAD

The Novel Materials Discovery (NOMAD) Laboratory [5] is a user-driven platform designed for the purpose of sharing and leveraging computational materials science data. The project's primary objective, pursued since 2014, is to handle and disseminate materials science data in a manner that adheres to the principles of being Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR). This endeavor is facilitated through their [website](https://nomad-lab.eu), which is an integral component of the NOMAD Laboratory. NOMAD provides such platform for researchers to upload, publish, explore, and analyze materials data from different sources, codes, and workflows. NOMAD also offers a common data format, a rich metadata schema, and an AI toolkit for machine learning. On the NOMAD website, users can search and browse millions of data entries by various criteria, such as composition, method, property, or quantity. Among more than 12 million entries, 4.24M entries have density of states; 454K entries have band gap; 421k entries have band structure, which can be accessed  programmatically through NOMAD’s API as well. The database is free and open source, and it is developed by the FAIRmat consortium. We construct a random dataset split based of 138,820 bulk material structures in the dataset with a 20\% validation split.

### Carolina Materials Database

The [Carolina Materials Database (CMD)](http://www.carolinamatdb.org/) [6] is a web-based platform that provides access to a large collection of hypothetical cubic crystal structures and their computed properties. CMD was created by using a deep generative model called CubicGAN, which can generate novel and realistic cubic crystal structures from random noise vectors. CMD currently contains 214,436 inorganic material compounds with over 250,000 calculated properties, such as formation energy, band gap, density of states, and phonon dispersion. Users can browse, search, and download the data from the CMD website, as well as submit their own queries for new structures. We construct a random dataset split based of 214,435 bulk material structures in the dataset with a 20% validation split.
